Additional context
Interoperability Protocols Play A Crucial Role In Enabling Communication & Interaction Between Different Systems, Software Applications & Technologies.
At The Moment Scroll Is Deployed On Orbiter, Owlto, Rhino, Layerswap & Layerzero But Its Not Deployed On Other Interoperability Protocols That Connects It To Other Evm, Non Evm & L1 Blockchains Like Solana Near Fuse Aptos Sei Oasis & A Lot More
Deploying Scroll On Axelar, Wormhole, Jumper Would Connect A Long List Of L1 & Non Evm Blockchains To Scroll, There By Enabling Easy Acccessibilty & A Very Fast Onboarding.
